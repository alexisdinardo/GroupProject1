## Warnings

For minor infringements on the code of conduct, you will recieve a warning. 
We opperate on a "3 strikes your out" policy, meaning that once you recieve 3 warnings, your next
offense will result in a ban.
All warnings will clearly state how you broke the code of conduct, and will be sent by one of 
the moderators. Some form of apology might be requested within a written warning.

## Bans

A ban will only be issued if you have already been given 3 warnings, or your offense was large in issue
and scale.
A ban after three warnings can last anywhere from 1 week to 3 weeks, which will be specified in your ban notice.
You will always be told what you are banned for in these ban notices as well, and they will be issued by a 
moderator.
If you have already served a ban and you are banned again, this second ban will be permanent.
If you are banned for committing a large offense, your ban will most likely be permanent.
All permanent bans can be appealed, but it will require some form of proof that you have learned from your 
actions. In this case, the ban will not be revoked, but it will be lessened to a few months or a year.
When you are banned, you will have no access to the repository and cannot make contributions or provide 
feedback on other community member's contributions.
